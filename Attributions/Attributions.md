The following is an overview of all the quotes that were used in the reading, including their original source. Text that has been extracted is highlighted, while for any instances where words were altered in an unclear way, some clarification is also provided. Finally, the quotes are broken down into which paragraph of the reading they are used for. 

## First Paragraph

“The cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be.” - Carl Sagan, Cosmos, 1980

- I added ", the universe," to help provide context to anyone less familiar with the word cosmos.

“The size and age of the cosmos are beyond ordinary human understanding." - Carl Sagan, Cosmos, 1980


## Second Paragraph

“**_The Earth is a place. It is by no means the only place. It is not even a typical place. No planet or star or galaxy can be typical, because the cosmos is mostly empty. The only typical place is within the vast, cold, universal vacuum, the everlasting night of intergalactic space, a place so strange and desolate that, by comparison, planets and stars and galaxies seem achingly rare and lovely. If we were randomly inserted into the cosmos, the chance that we would find ourselves on or near a planet would be less than one in a billion trillion trillion. In everyday life such odds are called compelling._** Worlds are precious.” - Carl Sagan, Cosmos, 1980


## Third Paragraph

"_**Lost somewhere between immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home.**_ In a cosmic perspective, most human concerns seem insignificant, even petty. And yet _**our species is young and curious and brave and shows much promise.**_ In the last few millennia we have made the most astonishing and unexpected discoveries about the cosmos and our place within it, explorations that are exhilarating to consider. They remind us that humans have evolved to wonder, that understanding is a joy, that knowledge is prerequisite to survival. I believe our future depends on how well we know this cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky.” - Carl Sagan, Cosmos, 1980

“_**Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious.**_ If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.” - Carl Sagan, Cosmos, 1980

- The above two quotes are the basis of one of the most heavily edited sentences, which is “Lost somewhere between this immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home, and living here is our species - young, curious, and in the cosmic perspective, every single one of us precious.”.

“_**We are the local embodiment of a cosmos grown to self-awareness.**_ We have begun to contemplate our origins: _**starstuff pondering the stars**_; organized assemblages of ten billion billion billion atoms considering the evolution of atoms; tracing the long journey by which, here at least, consciousness arose. Our loyalties are to the species and the planet. We speak for Earth. Our obligation to survive is owed not just to ourselves but also to that cosmos, ancient and vast, from which we spring.” - Carl Sagan, Cosmos, 1980

“The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” - Carl Sagan, Cosmos, 1980

- "Calcium in our teeth" was removed, "carbon in our apple pies" was changed to "carbon in our cells", and "made" was changed to "forged". This was the only change I made on the subjective basis that I thought it sounded more impactful for this setting. 

“These are some of the things that hydrogen atoms do, given fifteen billion years of cosmic evolution.” - Carl Sagan, Cosmos, 1980

## Fourth Paragraph

“When my husband died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, many people would come up to me - it still sometimes happens - and ask me if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently ask me if I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again. I don't ever expect to be reunited with Carl. But, the great thing is that when we were together, for nearly twenty years,_ **we lived with a vivid appreciation of how brief and precious life is.**_ We never trivialized the meaning of death by pretending it was anything other than a final parting. _**Every single moment that we were alive and we were together was miraculous**_ - not miraculous in the sense of inexplicable or supernatural. _**We knew we were beneficiaries of chance. . . . That pure chance could be so generous and so kind. . . . That we could find each other, as Carl wrote so beautifully in cosmos, you know, in the vastness of space and the immensity of time. . . .**_ That we could be together for twenty years. That is something which sustains me and it’s much more meaningful. . . . _**The way he treated me and the way I treated him, the way we took care of each other and our family, while he lived.**_ That is so much more important than the idea I will see him someday. I don't think I'll ever see Carl again. But I saw him. We saw each other. We found each other in the cosmos, and that was wonderful.” - Ann Druyan, article in Skeptical Inquirer, 2003

- I wrote “treat each other with love”, because I think it’s fair to assume this is what Ann Druyan meant in the associated quote, but something like the original of “the way we treat each other” sounded too vague for the setting. I also re-ordered these sentences to compact it and combine it with the sentiment that the precious moments together are miraculous. 

“_**The world is so exquisite with so much love and moral depth**_, that there is no reason to deceive ourselves with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence. Far better it seems to me, in our vulnerability, is to look death in the eye and to be grateful every day for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides.” -  Carl Sagan, Billions & Billions, 1997

“In the vastness of space and the immensity of time, it is my joy to share a planet and an epoch with Annie." - Carl Sagan, Cosmos, 1980

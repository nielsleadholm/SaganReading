The following is an overview of all the quotes that were used in the reading, including their original source. Text that has been extracted is highlighted, while any instances where words were altered in an unclear way, some clarification is also provided. 

“**_The Earth is a place. It is by no means the only place. It is not even a typical place. No planet or star or galaxy can be typical, because the cosmos is mostly empty. The only typical place is within the vast, cold, universal vacuum, the everlasting night of intergalactic space, a place so strange and desolate that, by comparison, planets and stars and galaxies seem achingly rare and lovely. If we were randomly inserted into the cosmos, the chance that we would find ourselves on or near a planet would be less than one in a billion trillion trillion. In everyday life such odds are called compelling._** Worlds are precious.” - Carl Sagan, Cosmos, 1980



“_**Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious.**_ If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.” - Carl Sagan, Cosmos, 1980


“The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” - Carl Sagan, Cosmos, 1980

The order of the the items was changed, "calcium in our teeth" was changed to "carbon in our cells", and "made" was changed to "forged". This is the only real 'artistic' change to any of the quotes. 


“_**The world is so exquisite with so much love and moral depth**_, that there is no reason to deceive ourselves with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence. Far better it seems to me, in our vulnerability, is to look death in the eye and to be grateful every day for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides.” -  Carl Sagan, Billions & Billions, 1997

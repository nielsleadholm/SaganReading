# The Reading

## That Chance Could Be So Kind

The following is a reading based on the words of Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan, husband and wife, and two of the great science communicators of the 20th century. 

The cosmos - the universe - is all that is, or ever was, or ever will be. Its size and age are beyond ordinary human understanding. Our feeblest contemplations of its nature stir us. 

Within the cosmos, the Earth is a place. It is by no means the only place. It is not even, a typical place. No planet or star or galaxy can be typical, because the cosmos is mostly empty. The only typical place is within the vast, universal vacuum, the everlasting night of intergalactic space, a place so strange and desolate that, by comparison, planets and stars and galaxies seem achingly rare and lovely. If we were randomly inserted into the cosmos, the chance that we would find ourselves on or near a planet would be less than one in a billion trillion trillion. In everyday life, such odds are called compelling. 

Lost somewhere between this immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home, and living here is our species - young, curious, and in the cosmic perspective, every single one of us precious. We are no less than the local embodiment of a cosmos grown to self-awareness. The carbon in our cells, the nitrogen in our DNA, and the iron in our blood were forged in the interiors of collapsing stars. In short, we are one of the things that hydrogen atoms do, given fifteen billion years of cosmic evolution. Starstuff pondering the stars. 

It is with this understanding that we should live with a vivid appreciation of how brief and precious life is. The world is so exquisite, with so much love and moral depth. Every single moment that we are alive and we are together, every opportunity to treat each other with love, and to take care of one another, these are miraculous. We are beneficiaries of chance - that pure chance could be so generous and so kind… that in the vastness of space, and the immensity of time, we would find one another. And so it is my joy, and my privilege, to share a planet and an epoch with you. 


# Background

The intent of the project was to create a reading that made use of the beautiful words that both Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan have expressed, while conveying an overall narrative that would be fitting for a setting such as a non-religious wedding. I do not claim that Carl Sagan or Ann Druyan expressed the overall view in this reading, since by rearranging the words, their meaning has by definition been altered. However, the effort was born out of a profound respect for how eloquently they have discussed life and the Cosmos. In fact, it was inspired by the rearrangement first done by (user) (link), which in turn was a project inspired by the "Cosmic Love" reading sometimes attributed to Carl Sagan, but which contains a final sentence with no known attribution to Carl Sagan.

In the process of rearranging the quotes to create a narrative, I have also added some filler words (e.g. for context or general flow), although I have tried my best to avoid adding anything that goes beyond the intent of a particular quote instance. The most heavily edited sentences vs. their original forms are :
_“Lost somewhere between this immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home, and living here is our species - young, curious, and in the cosmic perspective, every single one of us precious.”_
and
_“Every single moment that we are alive and we are together, every opportunity to treat each other with love, and to take care of one another, these are miraculous.”_
I wrote _“treat each other with love”_, because I think it’s fair to assume this is what Ann Druyan meant in the associated quote, but something like the original of _“the way we treat each other”_ sounded too vague for the setting.
